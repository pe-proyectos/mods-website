  instructions: `A text is a composition of signs encoded in a writing system that forms a unit of meaning. It is also a composition of printable characters (with graphemes) generated by an encryption algorithm which, although they may not make sense to just anyone, can be deciphered by their original recipient. In other words, a text is a network of signs with a communicative intention that acquires meaning in a given context.

The ideas communicated by a text are contained in what are usually referred to as "macropropositions," higher or global level structural units that provide coherence to the text by constituting its central thread, the structural skeleton that binds formal high-level linguistic elements, such as titles and subtitles, the sequence of paragraphs, etc. In contrast, "micropropositions" are the elements that aid in the cohesion of a text but on a more particular or local level. This distinction was made by Teun van Dijk in 1980.

The microstructural or local level is associated with the concept of cohesion. It refers to one of the phenomena inherent to coherence, namely, the particular and local relationships that occur between linguistic elements, both those that refer to each other and those that function to connect and organize.

It is also a set of sentences grouped into paragraphs that discuss a specific topic.
